# Latte Art PX62000

This is our senior project at Cal Poly Pomona. The objective of this project is to create a machine that will create a drawing on the latte foam

The hardware was designed and created from scratch, with many of the concepts and implementations inspired from x-y plotters and 3D printers.

A C# program was created to take in an image and convert it to black and white with a lookup table. 0 would indicate white while 1 would indicate black.

Our arduino code is going to use the lookup table to create the drawing
